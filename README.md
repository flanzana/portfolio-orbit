## Perks of using the design system in frontend development

### Introduction

This project was created with [Kiwi.com’s design system Orbit](https://orbit.kiwi/) components for 
workshop *Perks of using the design system in frontend development* at the event 
[Women in Tech](https://www.womenintech.cz/) in Brno, Czech Republic on May 18, 2019. The final result 
of this workshop will be a portfolio website, such as [https://flanzana.github.io/portfolio-orbit](https://flanzana.github.io/portfolio-orbit).

### About the workshop

In the workshop *Perks of using the design system in frontend development*, 
Žana will show you how working with a design system, such as 
Kiwi.com’s design system Orbit, makes frontend developer’s life 
easier and can save hours of working time. She will walk you through different Orbit 
components and display examples of their use. During the workshop, you will also 
create your own website by using Orbit components only.

### Who can attend the workshop

Although Orbit is using framework ReactJS, Žana simplified the whole project as much as possible, 
so everyone with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can follow the workshop.

### Required equipment

We will be coding in [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io), so the only thing you need 
is a laptop and browser (Google Chrome recommended). No additional software needed.
